# Lights Out 

Class assignment 8.

How the game works:

  Three ways to start:
    1. Click any square upon starting the program
    2. Click "New Game"
    3. Upload a game file ("Load Game")

  Clicking a square will cause the square itself, 
  and the squares above, below, to the left, and to the right 
  of the square to change color (white to black, black to white).

  Hint:
    Gives a hint on which square to click. The coordinates are in row-col form, starting from 0.
    
  How to win: 
    Make all the squares black (hence the title lights out)
